This is a video reccomendation machine learning project that reccommends videos based on title, date, user name, views , up votes, and comments
Data was scraped from theYNC.com via selenium and beutifulsoup4
the reccomendation system is based off pandas, cosine similarity, difflib, and sklearn
This was a project I made soley for fun, however theYNC.com is a video site that does not currently have a recommendation system
If the YNC.com would like to use my code they can!
